								<h3>AIE</h3>
								<p>This game was my end of year project which I worked on as my end of year project for my first year at AIE. I had a lot of fun during this project and enjoyed working properly with a team!</p>
								<p>Race Against Space was my first project which involved working in a group. I was one of the 3 programmers on my team, there was also 3 artists and 2 designers. I worked on the UI code and setting up the xinput, this was my first time working with both UI and XInput. UI code was fun to learn as it was cool to have visual elements react to what was happening on screen. Learning how to use XInput was quite enjoyable as well and it will be helpful for making future games which include controller support.</p>
